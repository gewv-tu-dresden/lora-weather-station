## Working Principle of
### measuring the concentration of particulate matter

A Particulate Matter Sensor is a laser-based sensor which detects and counts particles of different sizes using light scattering. Particles between 0.3 to 10 μm are detected in the air. There will be a distinction between PM2.5 and PM10 with a detection concentration range from 0 µg/m3 to 1,000 µg/m3.

Air quality guideline is an annual mean concentration guideline for particulate matter from the World Health Organization. The guideline stipulates that PM2.5 not exceed 10 μg/m3 annual mean, or 25 μg/m3 24-hour mean; and that PM10 not exceed 20 μg/m3 annual mean, or 50 μg/m3 24-hour mean

The size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest problems, because they can get deep into your lungs,and some may even get into your bloodstream. Exposure to such particles can affect both your lungs and your heart. Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including:

    * premature death in people with heart or lung disease
    * nonfatal heart attacks
    * irregular heartbeat
    * aggravated asthma
    * decreased lung function
    * increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing   or difficulty breathing.
