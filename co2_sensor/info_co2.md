## Working Principle of
### measuring carbon dioxid concentration

The SCD30 from Sensirion is a high quality NDIR (nondispersive infrared sensor) based CO₂ sensor capable of detecting 400 to 10000ppm with an accuracy of ±(30ppm+3%). The main components of an NDIR sensor are an infrared source (lamp), a sample chamber, a light filter and an infrared detector. The gas in the sample chamber causes absorption of specific wavelengths and the attenuation of these wavelengths is measured by the detector to determine the gas concentration. In order to improve accuracy the SCD30 has temperature and humidity sensing built-in, as well as commands to set the current altitude.
